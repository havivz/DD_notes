Deface Detector was created to fill in the gap between active monitoring and passive monitoring and for security related issues. 



The basic need of every web application developer or hosting is to know when the site is down... With that said you can actually know when the down but you cant really know when your site was hacked or even defaced.  By placing your monitors internaly or externaly you could have a basic idea if and when your site has been compromiss by checking it on a few factors: mostly by using a technique called html parsing  ...       
1. partial http response like part of an expected code like a know javascripts or images. 
2.   Title of the webpage.     
3.   And even hashing the leanding URL with a hash value to check for diffrences.
Added to the project some example from a webUI that was specialy created for this project that's litterly changeing the view/colors based on the status of the monitor... 
Main idea is to place the WEBUI view at some NOC/SOC facility as screen to watch and alert base on its result.   For Siem interaction we have created a full syslog integertion that will upload the last time result to the Siem collector in your Network.
